I'm just at home all the time. Thanks god I've found my interest in music. So I could spend alot of my time with it. Mixing and producing became my everyday hobby. Doing smaller performances for friends is everything I do currently. To somehow make the time more pleasent. I decided to record my third house dj set. My favorite "sit at home and dream about summer" track selection to remember back.
