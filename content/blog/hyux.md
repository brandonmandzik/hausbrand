I got my controller back in april and decided to somehow fight against the time in corona. I started DJing and practicing a lot. Soon I started to develop a favour for house music. The 4 to the floor beat driven by kicks, claps, high-hats make me crazy. Playing it and remembering back to the time where I danced in a club ... Well to bring the feelings back I recorded my first DJ set focused on House music.
Randomly typed few keys into the textfield ... et v√≥ila here is __Hyux__.
