Pawsa is definitly a house club hero. His bass roles through you literally. His style forms a solid groove,  no suprise his label is calles "Solid Groove Records". As a new underground artist he explores the musical times before and combines his treasures with his modern style. The results are impressiv and animate me to dance .. no matter at which time.
