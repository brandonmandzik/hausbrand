The summer strives and it's hot in berlin. Practically it's a hard corona lockdown for everybody. But well ... the berliner club community is fighting hard for finding solutions. I got the chance to party a bit at limited open airs. 200 people max. Hm somehow it was still fine because it was better than nothing right. Party people even throw illegal raves at some point ... scary in these times.
Grooving through summer I recorded my second set to catch my summer feeling. I called it Groovery because "Welocme to the Groovery Store".
