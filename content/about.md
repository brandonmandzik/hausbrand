My name is Bob and I'm 22 and produce/perform under my artist name __'Hausbrand'__. Techno and House are my genres. I'm only here for the music and the ecstatic it brings. Growing as a human means for me also growing as an artist. With a friend together we found the record label __'Ultraschnell'__. _Which represents our fast and creative face._  

Someone told me once:
> You are the reason for a house fire.

I spend my whole life in the city and got the opportunity to dicover all corners of berlin. I know every club and the people here. The combination of all these small little things matter to me. It's just about you, the music and the moment. And I try to deliver exactly these moments to everybody. That's my goal.
