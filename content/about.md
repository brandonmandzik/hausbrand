Bob is 22 and produces/performs under his artist name ' __Hausbrand__ ' . He lives for the musical moments and his House style is memorable. Growing as a human means also growing as an artist. With a friend together he found the record label ' __Ultraschnell__ ' . 
_Which represents the Berliner's fast and creative lifestyle._  

Someone:
> You are the reason for a house fire.  

"I spend my whole life in a big city and got the opportunity to dicover all corners of Berlin. I know every club and the people here. But every time it feels like a new adventure to me. It's just about you, the music and the moment. And I try to deliver exactly these unforgetable moments to everybody. That's my goal."
